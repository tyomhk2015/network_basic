Subjective notes about network fundamentals. 💻<br>
(POV: A person who is new to network)<br>

The reason for writing these are to improve my weakness of understanding the network which, I believe, is crucial for web development. 🌎<br>

The notes will include personal ponderings about each topic and there will be some over-simplified explanations.<br>

For the convenience of searching for the terms mentioned in my notes, glossary section is added. 📝
