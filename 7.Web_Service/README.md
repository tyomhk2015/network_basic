### The Past of Web

(Background)

Sir Timothy Berners-Lee: Creator of HTML, HTTP, and Web.

Papers, or documents, have many references to other paper for evidence. To read the reference, researchers had to physically find the specified materials for detailed information, which takes some time. To solve this problem, Sir Timothy Berners-Lee came up with HTML, text with linking attached, which enables to readers to read the references instantly from the paper the readers current were reading at the time.

To send HTML to internet efficiently, Sir Timothy Berners-Lee made a protocol called HTTP, which is a protocol for sending and receiveing HTML files via internet. Thanks to the internet and HTML, computer started to link each other and the numbers increase as time went by. The formation of linked computers looked like a spider web, and this was the moment the term 'web' start to become common. Therefore, HTML, internet, HTTP, these were also wrapped up as 'web'. Anything that is providing some helpful information with web started to be called as 'web service'.
